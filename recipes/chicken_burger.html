    <h2>About the recipe</h2>
    <p>A great chicken burger recipe! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. While my husband and I eat one or two each, she easily finishes at least three. The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>
